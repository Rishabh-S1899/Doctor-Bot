      "This 60-year-old male was hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19 with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10. Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling a bit better, thank you.\n",
      "Doctor: I see from your clinical notes that you were hospitalized due to moderate ARDS from COVID-19. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had a fever, dry cough, and difficulty breathing.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During your hospital stay, you encountered some difficulties during physical therapy. Can you tell me more about that?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, the medical team instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. How did that approach work for you?\n",
      "Patient: It worked well. A position change to the 135° prone position took around 30 minutes, but it increased my oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear. The breathing exercises had to be adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Can you tell me more about that?\n",
      "Patient: Sure. I was instructed to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, I managed to increase my oxygen saturation.\n",
      "Doctor: That's excellent. During physical activity, you had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation. How did the medical team help you with that?\n",
      "Patient: They closely monitored me and gave me frequent breaks. I managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation.\n",
      "Doctor: I see that exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10. Do you have any questions for me?\n",
      "Patient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you, doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: You're welcome. Please make sure to follow up with your rehabilitation clinic and take good care of yourself.\n",
      "A 39-year-old man was hospitalized due to an increasingly reduced general health condition, after persistent fever and dry cough for 2 weeks. The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence. Therapy was progressively shifted to walking and strength training and the patient rapidly advanced to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before his discharge home. Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not so great, I've been hospitalized for a while now.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your general health condition?\n",
      "Patient: I've been experiencing persistent fever and dry cough for the past two weeks.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay. And have you been needing oxygen?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And how has your breathing been, particularly when you're at rest?\n",
      "Patient: My breathing has been rapid and shallow at rest and severely breathless during minor physical activities.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. Have you been receiving physical therapy?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, physical therapy has been focusing on educating me about dyspnea-relieving positions and the importance of regular mobilization and deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear. Has it been helpful?\n",
      "Patient: It has, but my anxiety and fear of dying have been aggravating my dyspnea and vice versa.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. That's understandable. Have you been able to walk to the toilet okay?\n",
      "Patient: No, I've been so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that it's been difficult to walk to the toilet.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. The physical therapist has been working on counteracting that vicious circle, right?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, the physical therapist has been actively listening to me, explaining why I'm experiencing breathlessness, and testing suitable positions to relieve it.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great. Have you seen any improvement?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, on day 2, my respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and my oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after doing some deep-breathing exercises.\n",
      "Doctor: That's fantastic progress. And have your dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they have. I've been regaining my self-confidence too.\n",
      "Doctor: That's wonderful to hear. Has the therapy been shifted to walking and strength training?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, it has. I've even been able to walk 350 m without a walking aid or supplemental oxygen before my discharge home.\n",
      "This 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after a dry cough for 2 weeks, oxygenation was poor and computer tomographic imaging showed typical COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead. After tracheostomy, passive range-of-motion exercises, and passive side-edge mobilization were slowly resumed, whereby asynchronous ventilation and hemodynamic instability remained 2 major problems leading to further sedation and relaxation, thus inhibiting any active participation. After 24 days in the ICU, the patient scored 1/50 points on the Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool (CPAx) and showed severe signs of muscle loss. The patient died soon after withdrawal of life support. Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not very good, doctor. I've been really sick.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. When were you admitted to the hospital?\n",
      "Patient: I was admitted about a month ago.\n",
      "Doctor: And what brought you in?\n",
      "Patient: I had a dry cough for 2 weeks and my oxygen levels were really low.\n",
      "Doctor: Ah, I see. Did you have any imaging done?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they did a tomographic imaging and found I had typical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And what treatments did you receive?\n",
      "Patient: I received lung-protective ventilation and sedation.\n",
      "Doctor: And were you positioned in a certain way?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they did passive mobilization and positioning into a side-edge position.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Unfortunately, it seems like your condition deteriorated. Did you experience any hemodynamic instability?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I did. It was really severe.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. And it looks like you developed ARDS as well.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: Were you put into prone positioning at any point?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, intermittently.\n",
      "Doctor: And did you receive continuous renal replacement therapy?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I did.\n",
      "Doctor: During the proning, did you have any physical therapists helping you?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they helped me with correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And did you experience any secondary complications?\n",
      "Patient: I developed a small pressure ulcer on my forehead.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. After your tracheostomy, were you able to resume any exercises or mobilization?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they slowly resumed passive range-of-motion exercises and passive side-edge mobilization.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, unfortunately.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the clinical note indicates that you passed away after withdrawal of life support.\n",
      "Patient's Family: (enters conversation) We appreciate everything you did for our loved one, doctor. Thank you.\n",
      "This 57-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, heavy dry cough, and fever 6 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning. The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy. Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern). When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques. The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse. To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow. After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough. He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning. To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night. Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization. At the time of writing, the patient was still in the ICU without ventilatory support. Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not too good, doctor. I'm having trouble breathing.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. When did you first experience dyspnea?\n",
      "Patient: It started about a week ago, after I tested positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like a dry cough or fever?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I've been coughing a lot and I've had a fever too.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. According to your clinical note, you were admitted to the ICU. Is that correct?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: And you were able to sit with a physical therapist before experiencing progressive respiratory failure?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And then you needed to be intubated and proned?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's what happened.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. It looks like you required a lot of respiratory therapy and suctioning. Were you able to improve with these treatments?\n",
      "Patient: At first, but then the physical therapists had to use manual airway clearance techniques because the suctioning wasn't enough.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And were these techniques effective?\n",
      "Patient: They helped, but after I was extubated I still had trouble clearing my mucus.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. You needed nasal rinsing and upper and lower airway suctioning, is that correct?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: And you were treated up to six times a day/night?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. It looks like you also received interventions like assisted exercising and mobilization. Is that correct?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Well, I'm glad to see that you're still in the ICU without ventilatory support. We'll need to monitor your progress closely.\n",
      "This 52-year-old male tested COVID-19 positive 4 days after the beginning of a dry cough, fever, and head and limb pain. One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission. Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not great, I've been feeling really sick lately.\n",
      "Doctor: I see from your medical records that you tested COVID-19 positive. When did you first notice symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: About four days ago, I started having a dry cough, fever, and pain in my limbs and head.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. One day after your symptoms started, you were hospitalized with exertional dyspnea.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, it was really difficult to breathe.\n",

      "Patient: That's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: After extubation, your oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, you were disoriented and couldn't communicate verbally.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I was really confused.\n",
      "Doctor: Your global weakness was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Did you notice any difficulty with swallowing?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I couldn't swallow properly and it was really difficult to eat or drink anything.\n",
      "Doctor: The specialized physical therapist confirmed that you had severe dysphagia with 2/20 points on the Gugging Swallowing Screen.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they did that test and it was really difficult for me.\n",
      "Doctor: You were treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. Did you notice any improvement?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, after a while I was able to swallow some food and fluids under supervision, but it was still really difficult.\n",
      "Doctor: Your cough strength was still weak, but you continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion before your discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I was really happy to be able to eat and drink on my own again.\n",
      "Paramedics found this 59-year-old female with dyspnea and an oxygenation of 65% on room air and performed immediate tracheal intubation. Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.\n",
      "On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen). After 25 days, she was transferred to the institution’s rehabilitation facilities, where a battery of tests indicated persistent physical function impairment (MRC-SS 52/60, physical function ICU test score17 9/12, Timed Up & Go 23 seconds, short physical performance battery 4/12). Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",

      "This 33-year-old female patient had typical COVID-19 symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, headache, and dyspnea about 1 week before ICU admission. She was intubated and proned due to rapid respiratory deterioration. For the following 6 days, her situation was unstable, and physical therapy consisted of prone positioning and prevention of secondary damage. From day 7 onwards, she started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized passively into a side-edge position. After extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness (MRC-SS 36/60). She also suffered from pronounced delirium and anxiety and said repeatedly that she had been abducted and that she believed she had to die. She seemed to feel threatened by us and it was difficult to calm her down. Due to the pandemic measures of the Swiss government, hospital visits were not generally allowed, but because her anxiety was limiting her rehabilitation, her husband was granted an exceptional permission to visit her. This seemed to give the patient a short sense of security, and she started to participate in some basic functional activities (CPAx 21/50). Nevertheless, the delirium did not resolve upon her transfer to a peripheral acute hospital. Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not very good, I've been feeling sick for about a week now.\n",
      "Doctor: Can you tell me what kind of symptoms you've been experiencing?\n",

      "Doctor: Those are typical COVID-19 symptoms. It's good that you came in for admission.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they had to intubate me and put me in a prone position because my breathing was getting worse.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. You were also receiving physical therapy to prevent any secondary damage.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, but my situation was unstable for the first 6 days.\n",
      "Doctor: That's understandable. But after day 7, you started to improve rapidly and could be mobilized into a side-edge position.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, but after they extubated me, I had trouble swallowing and my muscles were very weak.\n",
      "Doctor: That's called postextubation dysphagia and severe ICU-acquired weakness. Did you also suffer from delirium and anxiety?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I kept thinking I was abducted and that I had to die. It was difficult for the hospital staff to calm me down.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Due to the pandemic measures, hospital visits weren't allowed, but your husband was granted permission to visit you because your anxiety was limiting your rehabilitation.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that helped a little bit and I was able to participate in some basic functional activities.\n",

      "This 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke in addition to a dry cough and fever. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day but continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. Despite repeated proning, gas exchange did not improve sufficiently and the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days. After sedation was stopped, the patient continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or to follow commands. Physical therapy therefore focused on perception training, movement exercises, airway-clearing techniques, dysphagia therapy, and mobilization. A first SOEB trial had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability. Instead, the patient was positioned in a side-edge position (), which he tolerated better and where an intensive exercise training including trunk and head control was conducted. Nevertheless, muscle tone and strength remained severely reduced, particularly on his hemiplegic side, and a second SOEB trial failed again. Physical therapy was also limited because of reduced self-activity and suspected impaired perception and visual acuity. Consequently, occupational therapy was involved to create a basis of communication, to support functional initiation of upper limb movements, and to integrate perception-training into activities of daily living. Currently, the patient tolerates spontaneous breathing trials, shows signs of being alert during therapy, but cannot communicate. He is hemodynamically stable, even in an SOEB position, but remains functionally dependent (CPAx 6/50). Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, not so good. \n",
      "Doctor: I can see from your medical records that you were admitted to the hospital due to an ischemic left-hemispheric stroke, dry cough, and fever. Do you remember any of these symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I do. \n",
      "Doctor: Unfortunately, you tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 the following day and continued to deteriorate resulting in severe ARDS, intubation, and ICU admission. \n",
      "Patient: Oh no, I didn't realize it was that serious. \n",
      "Doctor: Yes, it was quite severe. We had to place you on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 7 days to help with your gas exchange. \n",
      "Patient: Okay, I vaguely remember that. \n",
      "Doctor: After sedation was stopped, you continued to be somnolent and unable to communicate or follow commands. \n",
      "Patient: Yes, I remember feeling very drowsy. \n",

      "Patient: That sounds like a lot. \n",
      "Doctor: It was necessary to help with your recovery. We also tried a first SOEB trial, but it had to be discontinued due to hemodynamic instability.

      "A 66-year-old male started to present symptoms of fever, dyspnea, coughing, asthenia, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS. After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair. However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes (). The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.

      "We report a case of a 45-year-old woman, a non-smoker, treated for type II diabetes under insulin and primary hyperparathyroidism. Her medical history dates back to 2006 with an infiltrated nodule associated with ulcers that grew gradually in her right thigh. The patient underwent surgery with an anatomopathological study. Skin biopsy objectified ulcerated epidermotropic dermo-hypodermal tumor proliferation whose morphological appearance and immunohistochemical data are in favor of LCH. Langerhans cells present positivity of the anti-PS100 antibody, anti-CD1a antibody, and anti-Ki67 antibody (60%), and negativity of the anti-CD68 antibody. The patient subsequently received 25 sessions of radiotherapy followed by six courses of chemotherapy with a low dose of oral methotrexate. After these treatments, skin lesions are stable. In 2020, the patient complained of an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of several infiltrating nodules, scaling, crusted papules, and ulcerated plaques. The patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions. After two courses, the patient was lost to follow-up. One year later, the oncologist referred the patient to the hematology department for a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. Dermatological examination found ulcers and necrotic lesions, purplish, well-limited, of variable size, not painful, not warm to the skin, and localized to the right thigh. The mucous membranes and integuments were unharmed (Figure ).\n",

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed in that hospital, showing a horseshoe kidney with severe left hydronephrosis and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with the largest one located in the posterior part of the left renal artery measuring 4.7 × 3.5 × 2.6 cm. Additionally, there were multiple stones (Figures , , ). Urine culture was performed and revealed that various organisms were isolated (10-100,000 CFU/ml). Urinalysis showed a small amount of blood with a moderate presence of leukocytes and a trace protein.\n",
      "At the end of 2020, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a horseshoe kidney with chronic hydronephrosis of the left kidney and a large mass within it centrally with further satellite lesions, which all likely represent UC and associated lymphadenopathy along the para-aortic chain (Figure ). Additionally, a finding of chronic pancreatitis was noted with dilated duct and stone, for which the patient was referred to the gastroenterology department.

      "An 84-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension presented with weakness, dry cough, and shortness of breath for four days. The patient had received two doses of the COVID vaccine, with the second dose in March 2021. In the ER, her vital signs were BP 133/93, HR 103 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 96% on 40 L per minute of supplemental oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and afebrile. Laboratory assessment is in Table . Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Chest X-ray on admission shows worsening right pleural effusion with new opacity obscuring the lower two-third of the right lung and a new pleural-based opacity in the left upper lobe (Figure ). CT chest with contrast shows large right pleural effusion and associated right basilar consolidation and abdominal ascites. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit and started on methylprednisolone, piperacillin-tazobactam, remdesivir, and baricitinib. The patient clinically deteriorated on Day 2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit for thoracentesis and possible intubation. Thoracentesis removed 1.95 L of bloody, serosanguineous fluid obtained, with partial resolution of the effusion (Figure ). On Day 3, the patient developed septic shock, florid renal failure, and lethargy and was started on intravenous fluids and norepinephrine drip. Chest X-ray showed near-complete opacification of bilateral lung fields and subsequently was intubated. On Day 4, tense ascites were noted and the patient underwent paracentesis, which removed 4.25 L of bloody, serosanguinous fluid. Renal replacement therapy started. The patient was deemed to have a guarded prognosis with multiorgan failure. Doctor: Good afternoon! I'm Dr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?\n",

      "A 66-year-old male with back pain and cough for two weeks was admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing on 8 August 2019. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the malignant tumor on the left upper lobe was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the multiple bone metastases on 25 August 2019 (Fig. A). Immunohistochemical (IHC) results of the posterior iliac bone marrow biopsy specimen showed the positive expression of CD3, CD20, CD34, CD235a, and NPO, and the negative CD61 expression. IHC results of an endoscopic biopsy specimen of the bronchial mucosa on the upper left lobe showed the positive expression of TTF1, CK7, NapsinA, Ki67, CK, and EMA, and the negative expression of CK5/6, P40, CgA, Syn, and CD45 on 6 September 2019. Histopathologic observations showed infiltration of atypia cells in mucosal and fibrous tissues. The detection tools of pathology and cytology included automatic IHC staining (BenchMark XT, Roche, The United States), digital slice scanner, image analysis software (Pannoramic 250, 3DHistech, Hungary), and microscope (Eclipse Ci-S, Nikon, Japan). Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma combing with bone metastases.\n",

      "A 4.3-year-old boy was admitted on April, 2016 due to 5-day fever and cough. He was in good health and had never been to hospital. Two days before admission, pulmonary CT from other hospital suggested inflammatory consolidation with atelectasis. Therefore, the first FB was performed to etiological diagnosis and atelectasis treatment on admission. FB revealed fibrinoid formation in the right upper lobe. After 2 days of treatment of cephalothin and azithromycin, the condition worsened and hypoxemia developed. Arterial blood gas revealed PaCO2 43 mm Hg, PaO2 56 mm Hg, and oxygenation index 266. Then, reservoir mask of 6 l/min was adopted for ventilatory support. Physical examination revealed temperature 38.0°C, heart rate 135 beats/min, respiration 32 times/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation 90% without oxygen administration, fatigue, and decreased respiratory sound in the right lung.

      "A 61-year-old woman with confirmed COVID-19 was admitted to a different hospital with a productive cough experienced for a few days. She required invasive assisted ventilation shortly after admission. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and arterial hypertension. Because of progressive severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the patient was transferred to our tertiary care hospital for kinetic therapy (prone positioning for at least 12 h per day) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) (A). Because of progressive hypoxemia, venovenous ECMO therapy was initiated 13 days after admission to our hospital (A). Subsequently, nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. After tracheotomy and weaning, ECMO therapy and invasive assisted ventilation were no longer required, but the patient still needed intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) (A).\n",
      "During the course of the disease, the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before the clinical appearance of jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels, but sustained synthetic liver function reflected by the international normalized ratio (INR) and serum albumin measurements (B–E).

      "A girl aged 12 years presented with fever, abdominal pain, and painful urination of one-day’s duration. The patient had tested positive for COVID-19 eight days before the onset of abdominal pain. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by the PCR of her NP swab. Per abdominal examination findings revealed superficial and deep tenderness in the right lower abdominal quadrant to palpation and localised tenderness to percussion. An abdominal US showed findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. IV antimicrobial treatment with cefotaxime and metronidazole was begun, and she was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy. An abdominal fluid culture revealed P.aeruginosa, Str.viridans, and Gemella morbillorum. Doctor: Hi there, what brings you in today?\n",

      "A girl aged 16 years presented with fever, abdominal pain in the epigastric and ileocecal region, nausea, lack of appetite, and vomiting of two days’ duration. Patient 5 had a recurrence of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. She had had the first episode two years previously, with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. She was treated conservatively with antibiotics; however, she was ultimately operated on laparoscopically. In her case, COVID-19 infection presumably exacerbated the course of appendicitis and resulted in abdominal pain that was a cause for diagnostic laparoscopy and further appendectomy. Unlike the four other cases in which the histology showed necrotic areas in the appendix wall, concluding that appendectomy was necessary (gangrenous appendicitis—see ), Patient 5’s surgery could have been avoided if symptoms had not persisted.

      "A 58-year-old Caucasian man did a video visit with his primary care physician, in which he complained of severe pain in the distribution of his herpes zoster that had occurred years before. No vesicles were visible. He was placed on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory during the day and Tylenol with codeine at bedtime. Despite receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccination seven months earlier, he presented to the ED with a fever, fatigue, muscle aches, sinus congestion, and a cough. COVID PCR testing was positive, but chest X-ray was normal. A comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were normal. He was discharged to quarantine at home. Two days later, the patient returned to the ED with acute loss of vision in both eyes to 20/400, no relative afferent pupillary defect was present, and fundus photography in the ED with non-mydriatic camera was normal. Additional laboratory assessments that were found to be abnormal included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40), C-reactive protein (33), and D dimers (2000). Chest CT revealed ground glass changes consistent with COVID-19; pulse ox revealed diminished saturation of 88%. A non-contrast head CT was normal, but an MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a large occipital stroke. The patient was admitted for Decadron, anticoagulation, and supplemental oxygen. Access to the monoclonal antibody was denied. The inflammatory markers and D dimer normalized, and pulmonary function improved. The visual loss was permanent.\n",

      "Case 1 was a female child aged 7 years and 11 months. She had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the anterior mandible. She had a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth, including the lower right central incisor, right lateral incisor, and left lateral incisor, at 3 years of age. Hypomineralized areas, brownish-white in color, were observed on the labial side of her lower bilateral central incisors (). There was no past medical history. Genetic screening was not performed; the permanent tooth hypomineralization was thought to be caused by primary tooth trauma. The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 6.5. Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, she no longer experienced pain with air or cold water, and VAS was zero. When patient came to the hospital one month later, her VAS score showed 4; therefore, the treatment was reapplied. After the fourth treatment, the hypersensitivity had not completely disappeared, and the VAS was 1. For the seventh treatment, patients’ VAS value of hypersensitivity pain were stable at 0.5–0. Furthermore, the surface of the brownish tooth had changed to appear almost cloudy after seventh treatment (). During the process of this treatment, discolored devitalized teeth, gingival inflammation and percussion pain did not appear. Digital analysis indicated a pre-treatment cloudiness of 6331 pixels, which was significantly reduced to 65 pixels after treatment (). In addition, the area of brown color decreased by approximately six-fold, from 12,898 to 2118 pixels. These results suggest that both cloudiness and brown color disorder were significantly improved.

      "Patient: Yes, the pain decreased, but it wasn't completely gone.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. After the seventh treatment, did your pain score stabilize?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, my VAS value of hypersensitivity pain was stable at 0.5-0.\n",
      "Doctor: That's great to hear. Did you notice any changes in the surface of the brownish tooth after treatment?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, it looks almost cloudy now.\n",

      "Case 2 was a male child aged 8 years and 7 months. He visited the hospital with a chief complaint of pain in the anterior maxilla following exposure to cold water. He had a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth at the age of one year, with composite resin repair of a fracture in the crown of the upper right primary central incisor. There was no past medical history. An abnormal position of the upper right permanent central incisor and clouding of the labial surface were observed, which were likely due to trauma to the primary teeth (). Examination results indicated a VAS value of 6 for cold water and 7.5 for air blowing. Immediately after treatment, the patient no longer felt pain with air or cold water, VAS was zero. One month later, the VAS was 4 by cold water and 5 by air. The treatment was reapplied once monthly. The hypersensitivity had become acceptable to the patient and VAS was 2 after fourth treatment. During the seven treatments, the pain did not completely disappear, the VAS by cold water was 1–2, whereas the VAS by air was 2–4. While extensive clouding remained, the color tone was obscured and improved (). During the process of this treatment, discolored devitalized teeth, gingival inflammation and percussion pain did not appear. Digital analysis showed significantly reduced cloudiness from 27,886 pixels to 7904 pixels (). The hypomineralized tooth was mostly cloudy, with a narrow area with a brown color. However, this area significantly decreased after treatment (p < 0.03). This result indicated that not only strong cloudiness but also slight brown color were significantly improved.

      "Patient: No, I haven't.\n",
      "Doctor: During the examination, we noticed an abnormal position of your upper right permanent central incisor and clouding on the labial surface. This is likely due to the previous trauma you experienced.\n",
      "Patient: Okay.\n",
      "Doctor: The examination results indicated a high level of pain sensitivity to both cold water and air blowing, but after treatment, you no longer felt pain with either. One month later, the pain returned but was less intense. We continued treatment monthly and your pain sensitivity improved to a VAS of 2 after four treatments.\n",
      "Patient: That's good to hear.\n",
      "Doctor: During the treatment process, we did not observe any discolored, devitalized teeth or gingival inflammation, nor did you experience percussion pain. A digital analysis showed a significant reduction in cloudiness on your teeth.\n",

      "Case 3 was a female child aged 8 years and 7 months. She had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the left side of the maxilla. The left upper second primary molar was extracted because of apical periodontitis and root resorption due to severe caries, at 4 years of age. There was no past medical history. Dark brown hypomineralization was observed on the buccal tooth surface of the first premolars (). The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 4. Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, her VAS was zero. When patient came to the hospital one month later, her VAS score showed 1; therefore, the treatment was reapplied. During the seventh treatment, the hypersensitivity improved, and the VAS was 0. The dark brownish tooth surface of the first premolars was changed to pale brown (). Digital analysis significantly reduced the area of the brownish tint from 4858 to 1755 (). On the other hand, cloudiness was not detected. Doctor: Good morning, what brings you in today? \n",

      "Case 4 was a male child aged 5 years and 9 months. He had visited the hospital with a chief complaint of cold water pain in the anterior mandible. There was no history of trauma and caries in the primary teeth and no other systemic history. The cause of hypomineralization in the permanent teeth was not determined. The brownish-white in color were observed on the labial side of his lower central incisors (). The patient also complained of pain from air blowing and cold water, and the VAS value was 3. Immediately after the treatment to suppress the hypersensitivity, his VAS was zero. After one month, VAS was reduced to 0.5 and VAS was zero after four treatments. Seven treatments improved the color of the hypomineralization (). Cloudiness areas improved from 6872 to 1903, and brown areas decreased significantly from 6595 to 1667 ().

      "A 54-year old woman underwent a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for a 2.3 cm rapidly growing thyroid nodule (). The cytological examination showed both solid groups and discohesive oxyphilic cells (Hürthle cells) in a background featuring lymphocytes. Based on these features, the FNAB was diagnosed as a low-risk indeterminate lesion (AUS/FLUS). Five months later, the nodule grew to 3.6 cm, and thus another FNAB was performed; a diagnosis of suspicious for malignancy was rendered. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy (nodule 4.1 × 3.4 cm) with cervical lymph node dissection, and a removal of the internal right jugular vein that was invaded by the tumor. Microscopically, a Hürthle cell carcinoma with foci of paucicellular anaplastic cancer was diagnosed (Stage IVB; cT3b cN0 Mx/pT4b pN0 M0). In particular, large epithelial cells featuring granular eosinophilic cytoplasms, hyperchromatic nuclei with evident nucleoli were arranged in a solid and trabecular pattern alternated with scattered anaplastic spindle cells and necrotic areas. Immunohistochemical stainings for pancytokeratin and PAX8 were positive in both these components. Conversely, TTF1 was expressed by Hürthle cells only. Thyroglobulin (Tg) immunostaining was negative in both Hürthle and anaplastic spindle cells ().\n",
      "Two years later, because of the appearance of a hacking cough, a 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed and revealed several millimetric lung hypermetabolic areas.

      "Male, 80 y/o, with a metabolic syndrome. He underwent thromboendarterectomy because of right internal carotid artery serrate stenosis. Due to bivasal critical coronary stenosis (anterior descending (DA) and left circumflex (LCx)) and severe degenerative aortic stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG: left internal mammary artery (LIMA-IVA)) and aortic bioprosthesis implantation (Intuity 25 mm) in 2019. Ten months after surgery, he started developing intermittent fever with serial hemocultures growing Enterococcus faecalis. TTE detected paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) with focal hyperechogenic thickening of the leaflets. Diagnosis of endocarditis was made, and antibiotic treatment was started (meropenem shifted to ampicillin and ceftriaxone according to the antibiogram). TEE showed a pulsatile perivalvular pseudoaneurysm in the mitroaortic intervalvular fibrosa (). MDCT was performed a few hours later, confirming the presence of a pseudoaneurysm with the maximum axial size of 15 × 10 × 30 mm communicating with LVOT through a 5 mm window, and also detected a periaortic abscess in the anterolateral side of the vessel with longitudinal extension of 4 cm, which was only poorly detected by TEE (a–c).

      "Male, 69 y/o, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and previous myocardial infarction. He was affected by severe degenerative aortic stenosis and underwent trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with LOTUS Edge 27 mm in April 2020. TTE performed a few days after the TAV implantation detected an increased transprosthesis gradient (maximum/median gradient, 78/52 mm Hg) in the absence of fever or positive hemoculture. TEE showed hypomobility of the noncoronary cusp of the bioprosthesis (). Valve’s thrombosis was suspected and heparin administration was started. MDCT detected a paravalvular leak caused by misfolding of the prosthesis’ frame; the suspicion of valve thrombosis was also confirmed by the finding of two hypodense appositions at the lower edge of the valve. The patient underwent balloon valvuloplasty with complete resolution of the valvular dysfunction (a–c). Doctor: Good morning, sir. How are you feeling today?\n",

      "Doctor: The CT scan revealed a complex low-density right hepatic lobe subcapsular lesion measuring 13 × 8 × 7 cm, directly abutting the right anterior diaphragm, along with diffuse gross gallbladder wall thickening with cholelithiasis and a moderate right pleural effusion. Due to this, we had to perform chest tube placement.\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, I see. So what's the next step for me, doctor?\n",
      "Doctor: At this point, we will need to monitor you closely in the ICU and continue with your treatment plan. We will also need to further investigate the hepatic lesion and work on managing your other medical conditions. If there are any changes or concerns, we will be sure to inform you and your family.\n",
      "A 29-year-old male, HIV-positive since 2015, severely immunosuppressed that was lost to follow-up before starting ART. He presented in March 2019 at the emergency room (ER) with a one-day history of fever, shortness of breath and cough without providing information about his HIV status. Initial assessment showed polypnea of 30 cycles per minute (cpm), hypoxia, fever (39 °C), elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and bilateral middle and lower zone air space opacities on chest X-ray. He was admitted to the ward and started empirical treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Two days later, he was transferred to the ICU with aggravated tachypnea (50 cpm), severe hypoxemia (paO2 49 mmHg) despite oxygen supplementation and pneumomediastinum, bilateral pneumothorax and diffuse ground-glass opacities on thoracic-CT scan (a). The CD4+ lymphocyte count was 6/mm3 and the HIV-viral load was 18,200 copies/mL. All other microbiologic tests were negative. Treatment was then switched empirically to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 15 mg/kg of TMP each day in 3 takes plus corticosteroids for a presumed diagnosis of PJP. Later the diagnosis was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence as Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) in bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL).\n",
      "Due to refractory hypoxemia and given the high probability of barotrauma, the patient was started on venovenous-ECMO(VV-ECMO) without prior tracheal intubation. He later needed intubation due to poor bronchial clearance of secretions and completed a 14 days-period of protective IMV in an attempt to reduce extra corporeal support. He completed 21 days of therapy with TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids according to recommended PJP treatment dosage (prednisolone 40 mg two times day for 5 days, then 40 mg each day for 5 days and after that 20 mg each day Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Not well, I'm still recovering from my recent hospitalization.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, I see from your clinical notes that you presented at the emergency room with a fever and cough, and were severely immunosuppressed.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I was lost to follow-up before starting ART for my HIV-positive status.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Your assessment showed polypnea and hypoxia, as well as elevated C-Reactive Protein and air space opacities on chest X-ray.\n",

      "A 64-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and chronic pulmonary disease presented at the ER with fever, shortness of breath and a worsening cough despite a previous complete course of antibiotics for presumed CAP. She was hypoxic, with isolated elevation of CRP and diffuse ground-glass opacities on thoracic CT-scan (a). Her status deteriorated despite antibiotics and oxygen supplementation in the Intermediate Care Unit, so she was transferred to the ICU and intubated. Three days after IMV and prone positioning, she was connected to VV-ECMO due to refractory respiratory acidemia. Anti-HIV testing was positive. Immune and viral study revealed severe immunosuppression (9 CD4+/mm3) and high serum viral load (4.050.000 copies/mL) and TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids were started for presumed PJP, at the recommended PJP treatment dosage. Diagnosis was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii in BAL.\n",
      "ECMO was discontinued after 10 days. During the weaning off invasive ventilation, there was recrudescence of ARDS with increased ventilatory parameters and need for prone positioning. Nosocomial infection was considered, broad spectrum antibiotics were started and bronchofibroscopy repeated, with persistently positive immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for cytomegalovirus in BAL. She completed a total of 33 days of treatment with TMP-SMX and 21 days of ganciclovir with respiratory improvement and started ART. She was extubated after 83 days and was transferred to the ward after three months of ICU stay for muscular rehabilitation, without other dysfunctions.\n",

      "A 53-year-old woman, with no relevant medical history so far, was brought to the ER due to a two-month history of progressive psychomotor slowness and confusion, which had worsened in the week before. At physical examination, she was agitated and febrile. Head CT scan showed some intra-axial lesions in the left frontal and temporal lobes. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) had mild pleocytosis and moderately elevated proteins. The serology for HIV was positive, and the nucleic acid test of the CSF was positive for toxoplasma gondii. She was admitted in the ICU with a de novo diagnosis of HIV infection, with severe immunosuppression (CD4+ count 28 cells/mm3), clinically manifested as cerebral toxoplasmosis. On day 3, she began coughing, with respiratory hypoxemic insufficiency and bilateral diffuse glass opacities on chest-CT scan (a). The presumptive diagnosis of PJP was posteriorly confirmed with both direct dye-examination and PCR positive for P. jirovecii in BAL. She was treated with TMP-SMX for both PJP and cerebral toxoplasmosis. Following one week of appropriate medical treatment, the patient had a favorable response, and was discharged to the ward for further care.\n",
      "At the end of the month, she was readmitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure and elevated lactate. Respiratory secretions and gastric aspirate were both negative for tuberculosis. Other microbiology tests (including blood serologies for other common opportunistic agents) were also negative. She repeated chest-CT, and had severe deterioration in the lung opacities, with bilateral consolidation described as possible ARDS and/or nosocomial infection. As she showed no signs of clinical improvement despite corticosteroids and High Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT), she was intubated, had a repeat bronchofibroscopy and started broad spectrum antibiotics.\n",
      "The patient developed septic shock and ARDS with refractory hypoxemia and she was put on VV-ECMO. The indirect immunofluorescence was positive for P. jirovecii in BAL. Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",

      "Doctor: Can you tell me more about your history and how your symptoms have progressed?\n",
      "Patient: I've never had any major health issues before, but my confusion has gotten worse over the past two months.\n",
      "Doctor: During your physical examination, you seemed agitated and had a fever. We did a Head CT scan and found some lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes.\n",
      "Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?\n",
      "Doctor: It's possible that you have cerebral toxoplasmosis due to severe immunosuppression from HIV. We found mildly elevated proteins and pleocytosis in your cerebral spinal fluid and a positive serology for HIV.\n",
      "Patient: That's scary. What's the treatment?\n",
      "Doctor: We treated you with TMP-SMX for both PJP and cerebral toxoplasmosis and you responded well. You were discharged from the ICU for further care.\n",
      "Patient: That's good to hear. But why was I readmitted to the ICU?\n",
      "Doctor: You came back with respiratory failure and elevated lactate levels. We ran tests for tuberculosis and other common opportunistic agents, but they were negative.

      "Patient: I see. What treatment did you give me?\n",
      "Doctor: We started you on broad spectrum antibiotics and put you on High Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT), but unfortunately you showed no signs of clinical improvement.\n",
      "Patient: What happened next?\n",
      "Doctor: We intubated you and started you on corticosteroids, but you still developed septic shock and ARDS with refractory hypoxemia. We had to put you on VV-ECMO and the indirect immunofluorescence was positive for P. jirovecii in BAL.\n",

Initial assessment showed hypoxia, fever (39 °C), elevated CRP, 6 CD4+ lymphocytes/mm3 and several ground glass opacities on thoracic CT-scan (a). He started empirical treatment with TMP-SMX plus corticosteroids at the recommended PJP treatment dosage and was admitted to the ward. The need for oxygen support increased in the next few hours and the patient responded poorly to HFOT. Twenty-four hours later he was admitted to the ICU and VV-ECMO was started. No tracheal intubation was performed. PJP was confirmed by positive immunofluorescence in BAL.\n",
      "After 9 days of ECMO support the patient became delirious and agitated, which caused flow problems in the extracorporeal circuit and eventually led to the need for sedation and subsequent intubation. He completed 21 days of treatment, initially with TMP-SMX, then changed to atovaquone plus primaquine due to hematologic toxicity. ECMO support was maintained for 26 days.\n",

      "Patient: Not really, doctor. Can you explain it to me?\n",
      "Doctor: Of course. Thrombosis means a blood clot has formed in one of your veins. The deep dorsal penile vein is located inside the penis and it's responsible for carrying blood away from the penis. In your case, it's blocked by a blood clot.\n",
      "Patient: Oh, I see.\n",
      "Doctor: We also conducted laboratory tests and found slightly increased D-dimer level, which may be due to the inflammatory process of COVID-19 infection. However, your fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, protein S, Protein C, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies levels are all normal. Your platelets and white blood cell counts are also normal. We also tested for anti-phospholipid-IgG, IgM, and lupus anti-coagulant and the results were negative.\n",

She had an erythematous rash on her trunk, cough, and respiratory distress. She was initially admitted to another hospital, but her condition deteriorated, and she developed shock and was referred to our PICU. She had complained of flu-like symptoms within two weeks of the presenting illness. She had a history of one episode of dengue fever three years earlier but no contact history with a COVID-19 patient.\n",
      "On admission, the patient was conscious, febrile (temperature 104°F), tachypneic, tachycardic with unrecordable blood pressure, and prolonged capillary refill time. SpO2 by pulse oximeter was 93% in room air and 96% with 2L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. Auscultation of lungs revealed bilateral diminished air entry with coarse crepitations, pleural rub. The abdomen was distended, full flanks with diffuse mild tenderness. She tested dengue NS1 Ag positive on the second day of fever. Management for dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage was initiated with inotropes, IV furosemide, and albumin along with IV ceftriaxone and amikacin. She was given oxygen 3L/min via a face mask.

      "A nine-year-old, previously healthy, developmentally well male child, weighing 31 Kg, and hailing from Dhaka, was admitted to the PICU. He complained of high, irregular fever over the previous four days and generalized body aches, headache, abdominal cramps with emesis for the previous two days. He had a history of dengue infection two years ago and positive contact history with a COVID-19 patient one month before the illness. He tested positive for dengue NS1 Ag on the second day of fever and was admitted to another hospital. Due to respiratory distress and fluctuating blood pressure, he was referred to our PICU. On admission, the patient had low mean pressure, tachypnea, tachycardia with a cold periphery. His breath sound was diminished bilaterally and course crepitations were heard on auscultation. He was febrile with erythematous, petechial rashes on both lower limbs, and gum bleeding. His rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and blood and urine cultures yielded no growth. Initial investigations revealed, thrombocytopenia, marked hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, altered liver functions, coagulopathy, positive C-reactive protein, negative procalcitonin, and slightly increased blood urea.

      "An 82-year-old male patient with angina on anticoagulant medication and without viral infection was referred to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC. His personal and family medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a huge HCC mass in segment 4 and PVTT invasion from the nearby portal vein to the left portal trunk, main portal trunk, through to the contralateral right portal trunk. The tip of the PVTT progressed over to the bifurcation of the anterior and posterior branches of the portal trunk. The anterior branch was filled with PVTT, while the posterior branch was filled with PVTT or blood thrombus (Fig. ). No apparent intra- and extra-hepatic metastases were detected other than the main tumor. Laboratory data showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/dL, total bilirubin level of 0.5 mg/dL, platelet count of 13.9 × 104/uL, and a Child-Pugh score of 6. Serum levels of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II were 90,770 ng/mL and 2847 mAU/mL, respectively. An antithrombotic drug was administered for the PVTT. Due to the overwhelming PVTT extensions, poor performance status, and old age, the patient was deemed not to have a surgical indication. Therefore, a combination treatment using atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT was selected. During preparation for radiotherapy, one-time atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) were administered.

      "Doctor: And the swelling became static and persistent in the last 2 months. Is that right?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: During the examination, we found a 5-cm long vertical midline scar in the suprapubic region. An irreducible soft swelling of 8 cm × 6 cm was present in the right inguinal region which extended up to the base of scrotum. Cough impulse was present, and we could not get above the swelling. The defect could not be localized. There was also a gradual growing difficulty in negotiating urethral dilators due to the path distortion by the contents of the hernia. Cystoscopy revealed narrowing in bulbar urethra with deviations in the proximal anterior urethra and the scope needed to be negotiated to reach the urinary bladder. Ultrasound showed findings consistent with right inguinal omentocele and a scarred suprapubic region. Defect could not be localized. Do you understand what all of this means?\n",
      "Patient: Not really, doctor. Can you explain it to me in simpler terms?\n",
      "Doctor: Sure. Based on your medical history and examination, we have diagnosed you with a right sided, complete, irreducible, inguinal omentocele with urethral stricture. We have planned for right open hernioplasty with cystourethroscopy to treat this. Does that make sense to you?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, doctor. But I'm worried about the surgery. Can you assure me that it will be safe?\n",
      "Doctor: We will do everything we can to ensure that the surgery is safe and successful. However, there are always risks involved with any surgical procedure. We will discuss these risks with you in detail before the surgery. Okay?\n",
      "Patient: Okay, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\n",
      "This was a 49-year-old woman with vulvar sarcoma who was irradiated with proton beam radiotherapy. Unfortunately, a very painful ulcer formed within the irradiation field one month after completion of treatment. Sustained-release oxycodone administration was started at 40 mg/day. The oxycodone dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 160 mg/day (MED 240 mg/day). The ulcer was treated with skin grafting and relieved the pain. The oxycodone dose was decreased every two days (). Mild restlessness occurred at 20 mg/day (12.5% of the maximum dose). Since the symptom was mild, the same dose was administered continuously and the restlessness disappeared after a few days. However, oxycodone 20 mg/day was continued for another two months before being reduced to 10 mg/day for 14 days and then discontinued. Six hours after discontinuing oxycodone, she developed cold sweats, malaise, and leg pain. Sustained-release oxycodone (10 mg/day) was restarted, and symptoms were relieved. This lasted for about five months because she was afraid of developing withdrawal symptoms. Final oxycodone discontinuation was achieved 323 days after the first onset of withdrawal symptoms. Doctor: Hi there, how are you feeling today?\n",

      "Patient: Yes, that's right. The pain was quite severe.\n",
      "Doctor: Eventually, the ulcer was treated with skin grafting and your pain was relieved. We then decreased your oxycodone dose every two days.\n",
      "Patient: I remember feeling a bit restless at 20 mg/day, but it wasn't too bad.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, that's a common symptom. Your restlessness disappeared after a few days and we continued administering the same dose.\n",

      "A 73-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident with a right-sided deficit and speech deficit presented in a somnolent state to the emergency room. The patient reportedly had generalized body aches, dyspnea, and cough, which had been progressively worsening over the past two to three days. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.\n",
      "The patient experienced a prolonged hospital course, remaining in the hospital for approximately three months. A brief overview of the first month of hospitalization is given as follows: the patient was started on dexamethasone, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone at admission. His condition was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed requiring multiple blood transfusions and a pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary embolism could not be adequately treated with anticoagulation due to his gastrointestinal bleed. His respiratory status declined, due to COVID-19, necessitating intubation which the patient required for most of his hospital stay. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued for the majority of his hospital course, switching to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient required two courses of triple antibiotic therapy to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to persistent leukocytosis and a chest X-ray significant for signs of infiltrates which remained following his initial treatment course for ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n",
      "During the second month of his hospital stay, after his initial antibiotics courses had been completed, due to worsening respiratory status, sputum cultures were performed on hospital day (HD) # 26 which revealed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Citrobacter koseri, which were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (). Due to his gastrointestinal bleed, the patient underwent an esophagoduodenoscopy and a colonoscopy. Esophagoduodenoscopy revealed mild antral gastritis with a deformed duodenal bulb as well as some mild diverticulosis. Colonoscopy revealed a large ascending-colon mass.

      "We present the case of a 46 year-old-female, never smoker, with a history of ulcerative colitis who initially presented as an outpatient for the evaluation of persistent cough, wheezing, and chest tightness for 6 months. Her review of systems was otherwise negative and her only medication included mesalamine for ulcerative colitis. She had no history of environmental or occupational exposures and denied any allergies. She denied any personal or family history of lung disease. Her vital signs were within normal limits. This patient was evaluated by pulmonology and was diagnosed with cough variant asthma and was started on montelukast and albuterol as needed. A northeast allergy panel was unremarkable. She subsequently presented to the emergency room with an episode of wheezing and chest tightness and Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) revealed multiple lung nodules with mosaic attenuation. The nodules were seen bilaterally in clusters, with the largest measuring up to 1.8 cm in the right middle lobe. Multiple serologic markers were ordered to screen for autoimmune disease including ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel, Sjogren's antibodies, angiotensin converting enzyme, and rheumatoid factor. These were unremarkable other than a positive ANA with titer 1 : 640 homogenous pattern. Due to uncontrolled symptoms, her inhaler regime was escalated to Flovent twice daily with as needed albuterol. A repeat CT chest 3 months later indicated no change in diffuse mosaicism and multiple pulmonary nodules, similar in size, with the largest 1.8 cm in the right middle lobe (Figures –). She then underwent robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy with fine needle aspiration, brushing, and transbronchial biopsy of the right middle lobe nodule (Figures and). Pathology from the nodule was positive for groups of bland appearing small blue cells, consistent with low-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid). Pathology was positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, neuroendocrine markers, and Doctor: Good morning! How are you feeling today?\n",

      "A 4-year-old girl was referred to our tertiary hospital for the specialist evaluation of a non-specific cough, which was present for 6 weeks, associated with a right pulmonary mass. The physical examination was normal; on auscultation, diminished breath sounds were present on the right side of the lung. The medical history and growth were unremarkable. Chest radiograph revealed a mass located in the right upper lobe and the middle lobe of the right lung, with a central area of calcification (Figure ). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the chest radiograph findings; a solid, well-contoured, heterogeneous, mass was noted in the right upper lobe and middle lobe of the lung with an area of central calcification (Figure ).\n",
      "No lymphadenopathy was detected. Microscopy, culture and cytology of the sputum were unremarkable.\n",
      "The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 10, haemoglobin was 11.6 g/dl and the leucocyte count was 8.8 × 109/L. The other serum haematological and biochemical results were normal. The serology of Echinococcus and Mantoux test were negative.\n",
      "The patient did not respond to antibiotics; therefore, surgical removal of the mass was performed. Thoracotomy performed on the right side showed a lesion in the lung parenchyma, extended to the upper and middle lobes. The differential diagnosis of congenital lesions of the lung was made. As there was no success with fine-needle aspiration in several cases, we decided to perform surgical resection.\n",
      "The lesion was resected and lobectomy of both upper lobe and middle lobe was also performed. No associated lymphadenopathy was noted.\n",

      "A 35-year-old gentleman came to our institution in February 2021 for evaluation of persistent fever and non-resolving pneumonia. He had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020, with classical radiological findings. He was managed conservatively under home quarantine. Two weeks later (November 2020), he had a recurrence of high spiking fever. Imaging revealed a left-sided lung consolidation. He was treated for probable pneumonia with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. At 1-month follow-up (December 2020), there was an inadequate clinical improvement with an increase in the size of the consolidation (Figure ). Bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. He received another course of linezolid antibiotic.\n",

      "A 28-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was associated with nausea. Two weeks prior to admission, she had symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which was later diagnosed to be amebiasis. The patient was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at the age of 6 months when she developed arrhythmia related to a cardiac rhabdomyoma. The rest of the medical history included adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, left-sided retinal hamartoma, and allergic rhinitis. She was previously operated 3 times for the removal of multiple renal angiomyolipomas and underwent partial cystectomy due to invasion of the tumor. Physical examination was normal. The laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and an elevated C-reactive protein value of 125 mg/dL. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed extralumination of the rectal contrast material at the rectosigmoid region, indicating bowel perforation. The patient underwent proctosigmoidectomy and formation of an end colostomy together with the closure of the anorectal stump (Hartmann operation). Two weeks after the operation, the patient developed a new onset abdominal pain. The CT scan revealed contrast extralumination in the distal ileum and the patient underwent ileocecal resection due to a new onset bowel perforation and severe adhesions. Several days after the second operation she developed fever and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection for which she took treatment. Both of the rectosigmoid resection specimen and the ileocecal resection specimen were reported as leiomyomatosis-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Fig. ). After 8 months of follow-up, the patient's rectoscopic examination together with a control CT scan was normal. At the first year of follow-up, the patient had an ileostomy closure surgery.\n",

      "Patient: Not so good, I've been experiencing severe lower abdominal pain and nausea.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. When did these symptoms start?\n",
      "Patient: They started about two weeks prior to my admission. I also had symptoms of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea which was later diagnosed as amebiasis.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, I understand. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?\n",
      "Patient: Sure. I was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis at the age of 6 months when I developed arrhythmia related to a cardiac rhabdomyoma. I also have adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, left-sided retinal hamartoma, and allergic rhinitis.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And have you had any surgeries in the past?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I've had three surgeries for the removal of multiple renal angiomyolipomas and underwent partial cystectomy due to invasion of the tumor.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, thank you for that information. Your laboratory work-up was unremarkable except for anemia (hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL) and an elevated C-reactive protein value of 125 mg/dL. We did a CT scan, which revealed extralumination of the rectal contrast material at the rectosigmoid region, indicating bowel perforation. You underwent proctosigmoidectomy and formation of an end colostomy together with the closure of the anorectal stump (Hartmann operation). How are you feeling now?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling better after the surgery but two weeks later, I developed a new onset abdominal pain.\n",

      "A 51-year-old male patient was admitted to our center because of cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. He had previously been treated with antibiotics (cephalosporin and azithromycin) over 10 days. However, the symptoms continued. A detailed medical history revealed that he had an episode of pulmonary cryptococcosis 5 years ago (Fig. A). He recovered without any treatment and became asymptomatic. He has chronic HBV infection and is undergoing long-term treatment with entecavir. In addition, exposure to bird droppings was reported.\n",

      "A 45-year-old man (occupation: medical doctor) visited a university hospital with a chief complaint of fainting 1 day back. He had no history of medical problems and was not taking any medications. He had hiked 4 to 5 times a week for 2 years. Syncope occurred while hiking on a cold winter night (temperature: −8°C). He fainted while resting for a while in a standing position after hiking at a fast speed for an hour. The witness reported that he lost consciousness for about 1 minutes, and no head strike or seizure-like activity was observed. Upon awakening from syncope, the patient had no syncope recollection. After syncope, the patient did not have any illnesses or symptoms, such as headache, cognitive deficits, or somnolence. He had no prior episodes of syncope or fainting.\n",
      "At the time of examination (the day after the syncope), his blood pressure was 122/77 mm Hg, and his resting heart rate was 75 beats per minute. Electrocardiogram, 24 hours ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring, echocardiogram, tilt table test, and exercise tolerance test showed no abnormal findings. In addition, in conventional brain and chest computed tomography and brain MRI, no abnormalities were observed. All blood test results, such as electrolyte level, hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level, were normal. In the physical examination, he did not show any neurological symptoms, including motor, sensory, or cognitive deficits (Mini-Mental State Exam: full marks, no patient's subjective symptoms). The deep tendon reflex was normoactive in all the extremities. Based on the patient's history and examination results, the cardiologist diagnosed the patient with transient loss of consciousness due to syncope. In addition, considering that syncope occurred during excessive physical activity at cold temperatures, the possibility of vasovagal syncope was thought to be high.\n",

      "A 43-year-old woman, who presented with a 6-month history of hoarseness, was diagnosed with bilateral vocal cord polyps after laryngoscopy. Preoperative evaluation using chest computed tomography (CT) showed an intact tracheal wall with no abnormalities. Hence, vocal cord polyp resection via TLM was performed. Before the operation, a skilled anesthetist performed routine nasotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope. The endotracheal tube cuff was filled with 10 mL water to replace air to make inadvertent laser damage to the endotracheal tube cuff more noticeable. During the operation, a saline-soaked absorbent cotton was placed at the subglottis to protect the trachea. There was no evidence of intraoperative damage to the tracheal wall.\n",
      "Fifteen hours after the operation, the patient experienced sudden dull pain in the anterior neck but no dyspnea. Repeat direct rigid laryngoscopy showed no abnormalities. This patient is considered to be a common throat in TML and discharged from the hospital. At 23 h after initial surgery, she returned to emergency room presenting subcutaneous emphysema and cough. Re-evaluation with a head, neck, and chest CT was done, which showed mediastinal emphysema and extensive subcutaneous emphysema from the base of the skull to the chest. A suspected tear on the membranous trachea located 4.5 cm under the glottis, extending to ∼8.5 cm under the glottis was noted (Fig. A–D). Bronchoscopy confirmed the tracheal rupture.\n",

      "A 27-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency room of this hospital with shortness of breath that started a week before admission. A chest x-ray performed at emergency room showed a left-sided pneumothorax (Fig. A), and the patient was referred to the department of thoracic surgery. The left lung of the patient was totally collapsed, and there was a high possibility of REPE upon chest tube insertion with the symptom onset of a week. Accordingly, after explaining this situation to the patient and his caregivers, a 12 French trocar tube was inserted into the left thoracic cavity of the patient. In order to allow the lungs to expand slowly, natural drainage was performed without suction, and the rubber tube connecting the chest tube and the water seal bottle was partial clamped. On the day after chest tube insertion, there was an finding of air leakage through the chest tube, but the lungs were not found to expand much as a result of chest x-ray (Fig. B), thus the partial clamped rubber tube was de-clamped. However, about an hour after de-clamping, the patient suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress, cough with foamy sputum, and vomiting. Immediately the chest tube was clamped to stop drainage. With oxygen saturation measured 75%, oxygen was administered to the patient via an oxygen mask, but no improvement was observed. In turn, a chest x-ray was followed during additional high flow nasal prong (HFNP) therapy, exhibiting REPE findings such as newly developed ill-defined consolidation in the left lung (Fig. ). Oxygen saturation did not improve even after HFNP therapy, and further, persistent cough with foamy sputum, shortness of breath, and a drop in blood pressure occurred. With the need for intensive care recognized, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and then was sedated and intubated to perform mechanical ventilation. After supportive care including mechanical ventilation, the condition of the patient was improved Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",

      "Doctor: Okay, and did they do a chest x-ray when you got to the emergency room?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, they did. It showed a left-sided pneumothorax.\n",
      "Doctor: Ah, I see. And then you were referred to the department of thoracic surgery?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: And they inserted a 12 French trocar tube into your left thoracic cavity?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",

      "A 9-year-old female patient arrived at the emergency room because of a 36-h history of intermittent right lower abdominal pain, anorexia, vomit, and quantified high-grade fever. She had no pathological personal or family history of interest. On examination, the right iliac fossa was tender to palpation and no frank peritoneal signs were observed. Initial laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an elevated C-reactive protein. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was inconclusive. A heterogeneous lesion of 40 × 37 mm within the colon, no appendix and some swollen mesenteric nodes of at least 10 mm were reported. A complementary abdominal CT scan revealed findings suggestive of ileocolic intussusception with an invagination area of approximately 6.6 × 4.9 cm. After surgical consult, the patient underwent an exploratory laparoscopy that required laparotomy conversion. A well-defined, 5 cm mass at ileo cecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes were observed. Preserved permeability between the ileum and colon, complete integrity of the cecum wall and lack of vermiform appendix were also reported. The possibility of an auto-digested appendix and a cecal tumor were discussed. At this time, surgeons decided to resect retrocecal and pericecal lymph nodes and send these samples to pathology before any further intervention. The patient was admitted to the inpatient floor where antibiotic therapy based on ampicillin sulbactam, and metronidazole was initiated. The oncologist department was consulted and complementary laboratory exams including liver and renal function tests, uric acid, electrolytes, lactic dehydrogenase, and quantiferon-TB tests were ordered. Only lactic dehydrogenase was altered. A chest x-ray ruled out mediastinal masses. No alarming findings were reported. However, the patient presented gastric distension, abdominal pain and fever by the second hospitalization day. The content inside the suprapubic JP drain changed from a serohematic aspect to a dense cloudy fluid.

      "Doctor: The ultrasonography was inconclusive, but we found a lesion in your colon and some swollen mesenteric nodes on the abdominal CT scan. It's suggestive of ileocolic intussusception with an invagination area of approximately 6.6 × 4.9 cm.\n",
      "Patient: What does that mean?\n",
      "Doctor: It means that there's a blockage in your intestine that's causing it to fold in on itself. We'll need to do an exploratory laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "Patient: Okay.\n",
      "Doctor: During the laparoscopy, we found a mass at the ileocecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes. We're sending samples to pathology to determine if it's a cecal tumor or an auto-digested appendix.\n",
      "Patient: What happens next?\n",
      "Doctor: We'll need to resect the retrocecal and pericecal lymph nodes before deciding on any further intervention. In the meantime, we'll start you on antibiotic therapy and order some additional laboratory exams.\n",

      "A 31-year-old man with UC was presented to a local hospital due to diarrhea and hematochezia. The young man was diagnosed with UC 3 years ago but didn’t receive regular treatment as prescribed. After the treatment of mesalazine, anti-infection medicines of amoxicillin, parenteral nutrition supplementation and protecting the intestinal mucosa, all the symptoms worsened, and the patient began to develop fever and facial erythema with blisters forming at the raised border of the erythema (Fig. a, b). For further treatment, the patient was referred to our hospital with the complaints of bloody purulent stool for 1 month, fever for 9 days, erythema and blisters on face for 7 days. The initial laboratory examination demonstrated an elevated white blood cell count (10.60 × 109/µL, normal range 3.5–9.5 × 109/µL), increased C-reactive protein (173.96 mg/L, normal range 0–10 mg/L), procalcitonin (1.93 ng/mL, normal range < 0.05 ng/mL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (1720 copies/mL, normal range 0 copies/mL) levels, together with a low haemoglobin (90.00 g/L, normal range 130–175 g/L) level.

      "Chief complaint\n",
      "Our patient is a 65-year-old male who reported severe and progressive abdominal pain of three days’ duration.\n",
      "History of present illness\n",
      "The patient was admitted for stomach pain and lack of bowel movements for three days. The patient’s abdominal pain became progressively worse over the two days prior to admission. The patient reported that the pain is sharp, localized to the left side of his abdomen, and worse with movement. The patient also reports nausea but no vomiting. The patient denied any associated chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever/chills. Abdominal X-rays revealed small bowel dilation; CT scan conducted hours later revealed SBO. The patient also reported a long history of tenderness and a mass at the side of his past hernia repair.\n",
      "Past medical history\n",
      "The patient’s past medical history is significant for an open ventral hernia repair with mesh approximately four years prior to this encounter (2017), as well as multiple instances of SBO since the most recent of which resolved non-operatively some 10 months prior (October 2020) to this encounter.\n",
      "Examination\n",
      "On examination, the patient was found to have abdominal tenderness to palpation on the left side with rebound, severe tenderness at the umbilicus with a palpable mass, and the patient was unable to tolerate nasogastric tube (NGT) placement. The examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n",
      "Investigations\n",
      "Both abdominal X-rays and CT were obtained. The X-rays showed small bowel dilation and adynamic air-fluid levels, with suspicion of either ileus or partial SBO (Figure ). CT showed decompressed distal and terminal ileum consistent with SBO, as well as soft tissue thickening within the central abdomen deep to the umbilicus in a region of dilated and decompressed ileum, which could possibly be the cause of obstruction and perhaps due to adhesions or mass (Figure ). No recurrence of hernia was noted.\n",

      "A 77-year-old male, with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diagnosed with left shoulder melanoma in 2015, treated by wide excision along with radiation therapy, had a relapse locally at the original site with lung metastasis (stage IIA; pT4, N0, M1b) and was BRAF negative in 2017. He was started on pembrolizumab in August 2017 with a cycle of every three weeks for treatment. Two years later, in 2019, he presented with generalized weakness, productive cough that was clear, acute on chronic worsening dyspnea, and diarrhea for the past week, with his last dose of pembrolizumab three weeks back. He denied any fever, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling. He admitted to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He uses 3 L of home oxygen presently requiring high-flow oxygen. On exam, he had audible crackles on the right side along with diminished lung sounds throughout the right lung. His chest X-ray (CXR) showed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates along with interstitial changes. The white blood cell count was normal. His chest computerized tomography (CT), as seen in Figure , showed severe bullous changes in bilateral lungs, a small right pleural effusion, a spiculated nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 1.1 cm by 2.2 cm, thickening of the interlobular area, and interval interstitial infiltrate in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. At this time, his pembrolizumab was discontinued, and he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including atypical coverage. Methylprednisolone was also started. He underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out infection, which showed mucosa inflammation of the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, and the anterior segment of the right upper lobe with dark yellow mucus plug seen. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures, viral panel, and Pneumocystis carinii smear were negative. He was discharged home in October 2019 Doctor: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: Hmm, not too good, doctor. I've been feeling weak and have had a productive cough for a while now.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, let's take a look at your history. I see you have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and were diagnosed with melanoma in 2015. Can you tell me more about that?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had the melanoma removed through excision and radiation therapy.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Unfortunately, it looks like you had a relapse with lung metastasis in 2017. And you were started on pembrolizumab for treatment.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: And your last dose of pembrolizumab was three weeks ago. Now, you presented with worsening dyspnea and diarrhea. Have you experienced any fever or lower extremity swelling?\n",
      "Patient: No fever, but I have been experiencing paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. On exam, I noticed some crackles on the right side and diminished lung sounds throughout the right lung. Your chest X-ray also showed right middle and lower lobe infiltrates along with interstitial changes. \n",
      "Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, unfortunately it looks like you have severe bullous changes in both lungs and a spiculated nodule in the left lower lobe. We need to discontinue your pembrolizumab and start broad-spectrum antibiotics including atypical coverage and Methylprednisolone.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, I understand.\n",
      "Doctor: We also conducted a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out infection, which showed mucosa inflammation in several areas. The cultures, viral panel, and Pneumocystis carinii smear were negative. We will continue to monitor your progress closely. \n",

      "Doctor: You were discharged last October, so you have already gone home. But we will need to schedule some follow-up appointments to check on your condition.\n",
      "A 64-year-old female undergoing chemotherapy and radiation for malignant mucosal lentiginous melanoma of the left gingiva (stage III; pT3, N1, M0) presented in February 2020 with fatigue and worsening shortness of breath for the last two months. She had a left modified radical neck dissection with resection of the left oral cavity. She then underwent 30 treatments of external beam radiation. After radiation was completed, she was started on nivolumab 240 mg IV every two weeks in August 2019. In January 2020, her nivolumab was held due to worsening transaminitis and thyroiditis, which presented as hypothyroidism and then hyperthyroidism after starting levothyroxine. CT abdomen was done at that time, which showed increased heterogeneous attenuation of the liver. She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. With her history of being a current smoker of 1 ppd for the last 30 years, she admitted to a productive cough that was clear in nature, chest tightness, and orthopnea but denied paroxysmal dyspnea and fever. Chest CT without contrast, done in February 2020, as seen in Figure , showed multiple pulmonary nodules with some interstitial/ground-glass changes in the upper lobes bilaterally, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, which were worse than her previous chest CT two weeks prior, as seen in Figure . She was diagnosed with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis. Her lab work showed a very low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of < 0.07 along with her free triiodothyronine (T3) being normal, free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6, and negative thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) antibody. Levothyroxine was then stopped. She still had transaminitis. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia. A higher intravenous dose of steroids was initiated. She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL with findings of erythematous bronchial mucosa of the right lower lobe. BAL results were negative Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling really tired and short of breath.\n",
      "Doctor: I see that you've been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation for malignant mucosal lentiginous melanoma. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\n",
      "Patient: My fatigue and shortness of breath have been getting worse for the past two months.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, and have you had any surgeries for this?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had a left modified radical neck dissection with resection of the left oral cavity.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. And after the radiation treatments, were you started on nivolumab?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I started it in August 2019.\n",
      "Doctor: I see that your nivolumab was held in January 2020 due to worsening transaminitis and thyroiditis. How have you been feeling since then?\n",
      "Patient: I've been feeling okay, but I did have a productive cough that was clear in nature and some chest tightness.\n",
      "Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like paroxysmal dyspnea or fever?\n",
      "Patient: No, just the cough and chest tightness.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. We did a CT abdomen in January 2020 and it showed increased heterogeneous attenuation of the liver. You were started on prednisone 40 mg daily, correct?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, and we did a chest CT in February 2020 that showed multiple pulmonary nodules with some interstitial/ground-glass changes. You were diagnosed with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis. Do you understand what that means?\n",
      "Patient: Not really, can you explain it to me?\n",
      "Doctor: Sure. Nivolumab is a type of medication that can sometimes cause inflammation in the lungs, which is what we're seeing on the CT scan. We've started you on higher dose of steroids to help with the inflammation.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, I understand. What about my thyroid levels? I remember they were low.\n",
      "Doctor: Yes, your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was very low and your free triiodothyronine (T3) was normal. We stopped the levothyroxine and your levels have been improving.\n",
      "Patient: That's good to hear. What about the cough and chest tightness?\n",
      "Doctor: We've started you on ceftriaxone and azithromycin in case you have a possible pneumonia. We also did a bronchoscopy with BAL and the results were negative.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, thanks for letting me know.\n",
      "Doctor: It's important that you continue to take your medication and follow up with us regularly. We'll keep monitoring your symptoms and adjusting your treatment as needed. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to contact us.\n",
      "The patient was a 79-year-old Caucasian male with a 7-year history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a complaint of abdominal pain. The pain started in the evening of the day before and was accompanied by fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. He did not complain of bowel habit changes, although he had a history of chronic constipation. Past medical and surgical history was positive for MDS and cholecystectomy. MDS was controlled with daily thalidomide, deferasirox, dimethicone, pantoprazole, gabapentin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. He also took erythropoietin and rivaroxaban three times a week and filgrastim every fifth day. The family history and habitual history of the patient were unremarkable.\n",
      "The patient was awake and oriented on admission, yet he was ill, dehydrated, and mildly agitated. He had blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, pulse rate 105/min, respiratory rate 17/min, Temperature 37.9 °C, and O2 Saturation 90% on ambient air. Tenderness of the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen was noted, without abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, or guarding. Laboratory results were as mentioned in Table . The patient’s electrocardiogram was unremarkable.\n",
      "Plain thoracic and abdominopelvic radiographs were normal. In abdominopelvic ultrasonography, mild fluid in subhepatic and inflamed echogenic fat in the upper abdomen and around the pancreas was found, along with duodenal wall thickening. With the impression of pancreatitis, intravenous Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, Ondansetron, normal saline, and one unit of packed red blood cells were administered. As the patient did not have a proper urinary output (200ml since urinary catheterization), the computed tomography (CT) scan was performed without intravenous contrast. The abdominopelvic CT scan demonstrated edematous wall thickening of the entire duodenum with water halo and significant adjacent fat stranding and swelling of the Doctor: Good morning!

      "A 19-years-old female was first found with occupation about 6.2 cm × 5.7 cm in the right adrenal five years ago based on CT scan at a regular physical examination, accompanied with fever and headache with high blood pressure. Tumor resection was performed, and pathological diagnosis was right pheochromocytoma. The patient was regularly subjected to follow-up.\n",
      "During this hospitalization, CT scan found multiple tumor occupation in left adrenal and paraganglion region zones with round nodular shadows. Meanwhile, she had fever and headache with high blood pressure. Based on medical history and examination, she was diagnosed as left pheochromocytoma. Meanwhile, the occupying lesions in right lung and pancreas were found, located in extrabasal segment of inferior lobar and head respectively.\n",
      "The case characteristics were summarized: 1. A 12y female; 2. Tumor occupation was first found in right adrenal; 3. Tumor resection was performed and the pathological diagnosis was pheochromocytoma; 4. Multiple round nodular shadows were found in left adrenal and paraganglion region zones after five years; 6. The symptoms were fever and headache with high blood pressure; 7. The diagnosis was pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) (Combined PPGLs); 8. The occupying lesions located in right lung and pancreas were scanned and diagnosed with masses. Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: I'm okay, just a little nervous.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand, but I wanted to talk to you about your recent CT scan. It showed that you have multiple tumor occupations in your left adrenal and paraganglion region zones with round nodular shadows. Additionally, there are occupying lesions in your right lung and pancreas.\n",
      "Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good.\n",
      "Doctor: I know it's a lot to take in, but we've been following your medical history closely since your tumor resection five years ago. Do you remember your initial diagnosis?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma in my right adrenal.\n",
      "Doctor: Very good. And the tumor was successfully removed through surgery. However, it seems that the cancer has returned and spread to other areas of your body.\n",
      "Patient: That's scary.\n",
      "Doctor: It is, but I want to assure you that we have a plan in place. Based on your symptoms of fever, headache, and high blood pressure, we've diagnosed you with a left pheochromocytoma. This is combined with paraganglioma, which we call combined PPGLs.\n",
      "Patient: Okay, what does that mean?\n",
      "Doctor: It means that you have multiple tumors that are secreting hormones, causing your symptoms. We will need to monitor these closely and treat them accordingly. We will also need to keep an eye on the lesions in your lung and pancreas, which have been scanned and diagnosed with masses.\n",
      "Patient: So what's next?\n",
      "Doctor: We will be admitting you to the hospital for further testing and treatment. We will need to manage your blood pressure and hormone levels while also determining the best course of action for your tumors.\n",

      "In December 2017, a 19-year-old female was referred to our hospital with a recent diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient had presented as pharyngeal pain and left neck mass with fever for 2 months. She had received tracheotomy because of airway obstruction resulting from the large mass arising from the left parapharyngeal space at local clinic. PET/CT scan showed a large solid mass located in the left parapharyngeal space with compression of pharyngeal cavity and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck (). The histopathological review confirmed diagnosis of HS. Histologically, HS is composed of large polygonal cells with epithelioid-to-pleomorphic morphology, abundant eosinophilic to vacuolated or foamy cytoplasm, ovoid to irregularly shaped nuclei, and variably prominent nucleoli (). For immunohistochemical markers, most HS express CD68 and CD163 and partially express S100 (). Chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide (CHOEP)) was initially started on December 8, 2017 with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx (). In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started on day 11 of chemotherapy. After irradiation of 20 Gy/10 F, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller (pharyngeal mass: from 6.0 cm × 4.4 cm to 5.6 cm × 4.0 cm; neck mass: from 3.5 cm × 2.8 cm to 2.9 cm × 2.6 cm).\n",

      "Patient: I'm feeling okay, thank you.\n",
      "Doctor: I see here that you were referred to us in December 2017 for a diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\n",

      "A 53-year-old female participant in the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial was included in early June 2020 and randomized to BCG, which was applied intradermally in the right deltoid region. A rather strong local skin reaction to the vaccine followed, with clear, yellowish serous secretion from the injection site lasting 4 to 5 months. Additionally, swollen and sore lymph nodes in the axil on the vaccinated side were noted. The lymph node symptoms led to her being examined for breast cancer in January 2021. The participant had been BCG-vaccinated as a child at school entry, and a scar from the childhood vaccination was noted on her right shoulder at the trial inclusion procedure. According to her mother, she had also reacted strongly to the childhood BCG vaccination. As far as she (and her mother) knows, she has never been exposed to TB. The participant is healthy and takes no medication.\n",
      "By the end of January 2021, she received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccination in the left arm. She received no other vaccines during follow-up. The participant reacted to the Covid-19 vaccine with fever, muscle pain, and a large local reaction (the area being red and inflamed) which subsided within a few days. One to two days after vaccination, the trial BCG vaccination site scar began to itch and she experienced renewed secretion from the site, and the lymph nodes felt sorer. The itching and the secretion lasted for a week.\n",
      "Three weeks later, she received the second Moderna vaccination, after which she felt ill again. Also, this time the BCG site began to itch during the following day. There were no other symptoms, and the secretion from the BCG scar did not reappear. The itching lasted for 2 weeks. No treatment was needed or provided. Again, she did not notice symptoms from the childhood BCG scar. Doctor: Good afternoon, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Patient: I'm feeling okay, just a little nervous about the test results.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. Let's start by going over your medical history. I see that you were vaccinated with BCG in early June 2020. Can you tell me about any side effects you experienced?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had a strong local skin reaction with yellowish secretion for 4-5 months, and swollen and sore lymph nodes on the vaccinated side.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay, and I see that you were examined for breast cancer in January 2021 due to the lymph node symptoms. What were the results of that exam?\n",
      "Patient: They didn't find anything concerning.\n",
      "Doctor: That's good to hear. I also see that you were vaccinated with the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in January. Can you tell me about any reactions you experienced with that vaccine?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had fever, muscle pain, and a large local reaction that went away after a few days.\n",
      "Doctor: And did you experience any symptoms related to the BCG vaccination site scar after the Covid-19 vaccine?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, the scar began to itch and I had renewed secretion from the site, and the lymph nodes felt sorer.\n",

      "We hereby report the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian female who has been followed at our Allergy Unit of Meyer Children's University Hospital in Florence for allergic asthma since the age of 6. At the physical examination, she presented a history of respiratory clinical manifestations such as cough and shortness of breath. During her asthma history, she also reported two hospitalizations: the first one during a wheezing episode triggered by an airway infection and the second one during an asthmatic attack without an infection. She required treatment with short-acting β2-agonist and systemic corticosteroids during her asthma exacerbations. The patient presented positive skin prick tests to house dust mites and cat fur from the first clinical evaluation and a positive skin prick test to pollen (grass, mugwort, hazel, birch, and poplar) during the follow-up.\n",
      "She also suffered from food allergy, i.e., to nuts, with sensitization to lipid transfer protein and profilin. At the age of 2, the patient had anaphylaxis after eating cashew and adrenaline autoinjectors were prescribed. She had skin prick tests, prick by prick tests, and blood tests for nuts, and they resulted positive not only for cashew but also for peanut, almond, hazelnut, walnut, pine nut, and pistachio, which were all excluded from the diet. Moreover, with carrots and fennels, she presented itch in her throat and dyspnea. For this reason, following the positive skin prick tests, the patient also excluded these foods from the diet. At 16 years old, the patient presented anaphylaxis twice after eating a pear and shrimps, which were then excluded from her diet.\n",

      "Patient: Yes, I had itch in my throat and dyspnea after eating carrots and fennels, so I excluded them from my diet as well. Recently, I had anaphylaxis twice after eating a pear and shrimps, so I excluded them from my diet too.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Apart from your allergies, do you have any other illnesses?\n",
      "Patient: No, I don't suffer from any other illnesses.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay. I also noticed that your mother suffered from nickel contact allergy and your father from rhinoconjunctivitis with grass. It seems like atopic disease runs in your family.\n",
      "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
      "Doctor: Based on your medical history and test results, I'll prescribe you some medication and give you some instructions on how to manage your allergies and asthma. Please make sure to follow them carefully. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask me.\n",

      "A 38-year-old woman, 32+ 2 weeks pregnant, previous smoker with a past history of one miscarriage and livedo reticularis was admitted to the emergency department (ED) of her local hospital due to a sudden onset of pain, cold and functional impotence of the lower limbs. During the obstetric evaluation, fetal death was observed.\n",
      "Given the suspicion of lower limb ischemia, low weight molecular heparin was started, and the patient was transferred to our hospital, which has vascular surgery. On admission in our ED, she was alert and oriented, hemodynamically stable and presented with tachypnea. Absence of pulses, cold and pallor of the lower limbs, with minimal neurosensory deficit and muscle weakness were observed. Laboratory workup showed hypocapnia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver and pancreatic enzymes, elevated total creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Table resumes clinical and laboratory evolution during hospitalization. The Computed Tomography angiography (Angio CT) showed bilateral (central and lobar) pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and left iliac axis, areas of splenic and right kidney infarction and multiple arterial and venous thrombosis. Juxta-renal aortic thrombosis (Fig. ) was also observed as well as thrombosis of the left renal artery (with hypocaptation of the left kidney), right common iliac artery, left hypogastric artery, left common femoral artery, right deep femoral artery and right tibioperoneal trunk (Fig. ).\n",

      "Patient: Not good, I'm in a lot of pain.\n",
      "Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when did the pain start and how severe it is?\n",
      "Patient: It started suddenly and it's really bad. I also have cold and can't move my legs.\n",
      "Doctor: I understand. You're 32+ 2 weeks pregnant, correct? Can you tell me if you have any past medical history?\n",
      "Patient: Yes, I had one miscarriage and I used to smoke.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay. During the obstetric evaluation, fetal death was observed. You were admitted to the emergency department of your local hospital due to a sudden onset of pain, cold and functional impotence of the lower limbs. Did they do any tests or evaluation?\n",
